# PhysicsExamples
Various examples of problems in physics.

Current Examples:
 - A notebook on pointing to a gravitational wave event with LIGO.
 - A followup on pointing with LIGO and Virgo. The three-detector setup has now been used to discover a possible neutron star inspiral event and point back to a small region in the sky.
 - A Python script and a ROOT C++ macro to get equivalent results to those in the first LIGO notebook.
